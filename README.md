# Projects
This is all the majority of my work done outside and some within my education at MacEwan University.
In AFinal I do not own any of the art/sound assets. All code was implemented by myself in 2 weeks.

# Capstone
*Daemon Killer:*
The capstone was made over 3 months and was made by myself, Tyson H, and Jacky H. It is a top-down horror game to give an old-school survival horror game feel. You play as a private investigator that is tasked with researching magical fluctuations coming from a mansion. The game plays with a semi-turn-based action system, as you run around avoiding enemies to wait for your turn to take action.

# Matching Fantasy
Matching Fantasy is a matching game that the Edmonton Public Library now uses on some of their touch tables. The game involves 1-4 players trying to match cards to defeat various enemies to get the highest score possible. It was made by Justin Y, Laroy M, Lou L, and myself. The main game loop involves the players working together to match cards that do specific effects like attacking, defending, healing, and mana recovery.

The link below will show a demo of the game, and within the description, you can download and try the game for yourself.

# StreamCloud
StreamCloud is a project that was developed over 4 months for a school project. StreamCloud displays the number of movies/shows present on a streaming platform by visualizing data. It was made to make the users' choice easier when selecting a streaming platform to subscribe to. 

# Chess
This was a project I had to make for one of my school projects. It was to re-create chess within the Unity Engine. All chess pieces function as expected and can take an opponent's piece. However, this project has one caveat: it will not tell you when a player has entered check or in checkmate.
