# About me
Hi, my name is Rozario Beaudin; I am a recent graduate from MacEwan University. First off, thank you for taking the time to look at my GitHub repository; I greatly appreciate that. <br /><br />Now about myself: I am an individual who constantly wants to learn from all my experiences to become a better programmer. Creating elegant, efficient and scalable code is what I strive to achieve. I accomplish self-betterment by constantly seeking criticism in all forms; it is an opportunity to grow and get a different perspective on how others think about a problem. Additionally, I believe that the best ideas come from many rather than a single individual, for that's when we flourish the most. <br /><br />Thank you for reading, and I hope we become co-workers in the near future!

# Daemon Killer
The project was made over 3 months and was made by myself, Tyson H, and Jacky H. It is a top-down horror game to give an old-school survival horror game feel. You play as a private investigator that is tasked with researching magical fluctuations coming from a mansion. The game plays with a semi-turn-based action system, as you run around avoiding enemies to wait for your turn to take action.

# Matching Fantasy
Matching Fantasy is a matching game that the Edmonton Public Library now uses on some of their touch tables. The game involves 1-4 players trying to match cards to defeat various enemies to get the highest score possible. It was made by Justin Y, Laroy M, Lou L, and myself. The main game loop involves the players working together to match cards that do specific effects like attacking, defending, healing, and mana recovery.

# StreamCloud
StreamCloud is a project developed over four months by myself and another programmer. StreamCloud displays the number of movies/shows on a streaming platform by visualizing data. It was made to make the users' choice easier when selecting a streaming platform to subscribe to.

# Chess
The project's goal was to re-create chess within the Unity Engine within a week. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of OOP and, in general, how Unity functions. All chess pieces work as expected and can take an opponent's piece. However, this project has one caveat: it will not tell you when a player has entered check or in checkmate.

# Marinara Platformer
The goal of this project is for me to learn more about Unreal Engine 4 with only the official documentation. It is a recreation of the classic game Mario Bros as the game’s simple concept helped tackle a somewhat unfamiliar game engine environment. I created all code and blueprints for this project.
Due to the size of the project, I am unable to upload the project to GitHub.

**WIP Adventure Project** <br />
I am working on this personal project to re-create a game in Unreal Engine 5 with a mix of C++ and Blueprints. The Adventure Project is an adventure game based on the original NES Legend of Zelda. The project’s 
scope is to re-create all aspects of the Legend of Zelda. I will only show this project upon request, as it is not ready to be displayed on my portfolio.

# Game Jams

**Alberta Game Jam 2022** Chaos Concerto <br />
*August 2022* <br />
Chaos Concerto is a rhythm game built with the theme of "breaking the rules.” The game follows the theme by having chaotic elements and hard-to-follow notes that you must match up with the correct timing.

I am the lead programmer for this game. Where I programmed all of the game’s mechanics input, spawning, etc., I had some help deriving the mathematics for the timing of the beats.

**Global Game Jam 2022:** World of Darkness: Yomi no Kuni <br />
*January 2022* <br />
This game was made over 48 hours for the Global Game Jam 2022. World of Darkness is a rogue where death is not necessarily the end if you die. When you die, you must kill all the enemies you have previously killed in the living world to revive and have another chance at your run.
